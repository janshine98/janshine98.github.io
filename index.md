### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it helped me develop my skills in programming. 
    I was able to practice writing function definitions by using Fliegel & Van Flandern's algorithm to convert two dates into Julian Days and then take the difference.
    Also, it was fun figuring out how to quickly calculate the number of days between any two given dates.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it taught me how to play Blackjack. 
    I was able to write a program that computes the score for a hand of blackjack and only deals with hands that contain exactly two cards.
    Also, it was interesting figuring out how to compute the score of the two given cards and print that number to standard output on its line.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it taught me about the averaging algorithm and pass-by const reference.
    I was able to write a function that computes the average mean of all elements of a vector except the minimum and the maximum.
    Also, I was able to figure out how to assign a score and make all of the scores get averaged together by an algorithm.
